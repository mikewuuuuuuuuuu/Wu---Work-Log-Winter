# Wu---Work-Log-Winter

### Week 5

The code stopped working again, I suspect this has to do something with Pycharm, have to figure this out.

Now python shows syntax error, asking chatGPT for help. **1hr**

It says python not found, redownloading.
After fixing, repairing python file, still not working. **1hr**

Will need further research into how to fix this, and perhaps thinking about how to add on more to my toolbox. 



### Week 4

Got a new pc, gotta download python, doing some pip installs.

Start learning and working on the google translator app in my Toolbox **1hr**
  Using YouTube and ChatGPT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?,  https://chat.openai.com/share/45540163-fb72-4b00-8c44-06ea6258de18

Not working asking ChatGPT for help

This is not working either, doing language translator is harder than I thought

Finally, it worked! But not in Pycharm, perhaps some issue with Pycharm interperator.
